            <h1>Missile Man of India</h1>
            <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam ; 15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist
                and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
                Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four decades as
                a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation
                (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
                space programme and military missile development efforts.He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of
                India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played
                a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the
                first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.

                Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling Bharatiya
                Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the "People's
                President",he returned to his civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single
                term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
                civilian honour.</p>
